# Xcode files for wya*

## Installing
If you are running this project for the first time, first install <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a>
 
then run the following command in **this** directory
    
    $ pod install

This will resolve all the dependencies for the project. It generates a `cs130_project.xcworkspace` file. You must now use this for this project from now on instead of `cs130_project.xcodeproj`.
